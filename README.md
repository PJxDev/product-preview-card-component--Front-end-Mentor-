## My process

I started with the HTML to give a structure view of the card.
After that, I added the classes and the CSS give a full view as the main design image shows.
Later on, I fulfilled the challenge with a couple media queries to change de flex direction and some properties for the image of the product.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design


### Continued development

It would be appropiate for this project to work in some more features like:
  - Hover for the button
  - Add a "add to your wish list" button
  - Add some more products
  - Add a database with the products
  - Add the API to connect to the database and retrieve the products
